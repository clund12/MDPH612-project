MDPH612 TERM PROJECT
====================

## Using a Raspberry Pi to translate breathing traces (from a Varian RPM system) into mechanical motion in a stepper motor.

### Aims:
- Become comfortable with a Raspberry Pi 3 (PIXEL for now)
- Obtain breathing trace (maybe surface trace) data and convert this to instantaneous velocities
- Interface with the stepping motor
- Convert these velocities into the rotation speed of the motor needed to induce the desired linear motion
- Get the track 3D printed, assemble with the stepper motor
- Extend to 2D if there is time
